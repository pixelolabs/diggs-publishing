They are my inspiration and support. Our toddler keeps us busy outside of jobs, but in our free time, we enjoy watching movies and traveling. In early 2021, my life was upended when I found out a child in my family was being sexually abused. The news shattered my heart and hurled me into a deep depression. I took time off work to focus on healing my family and myself.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>During my time off, I knew I needed to join the fight against child sexual abuse. In May of 2021, I founded the Kids Again Foundation. Kids Again Foundation is a nonprofit initiative that brings hope and healing to children traumatized by sexual abuse. This is accomplish by sponsoring their participation in youth sports leagues, music classes, art, and other fun and engaging activities. In addition, I wrote my first children's book, \"Where Hands Go: An Introduction to Safe and Unsafe Touch\". I wrote this book as a conversation starter between children and loved ones. I didn't have the conversation with the child close to me, and I wish I'd had. I pray, the book will serve in preventing child sexual abuse, and opening lines of communication between children and loved ones.<\/p>",

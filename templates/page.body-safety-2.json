The first initiative is the Body Safety Wise Author Visit Program. This program is dedicated to providing age-appropriate resources and lessons that empower children with the knowledge and skills to stay safe and healthy. Through engaging presentations and interactive activities, students PK-8th grade will learn about body safety, boundaries, and consent in a fun and approachable way. As an author and educator, I am committed to helping children develop the tools they need to stay safe and healthy, both physically and emotionally. <\/p>",

They will also have the chance to connect with like-minded individuals and build leadership skills. As an author, educator, and advocate, I am passionate about promoting body safety education and literacy. I welcome the opportunity to work with schools, parents, and community leaders to create safe and healthy environments for children. Thank you for considering the Body Safety Wise program for your school or child.",
